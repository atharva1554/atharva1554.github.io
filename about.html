        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="a.jpg" alt="Atharva Khairnar" class="about-image">
        <p>Hello! I'm Atharva Khairnar, a driven Computer Engineering student at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering and Research. My journey in the world of technology began with a simple curiosity about how things work. This curiosity quickly turned into a passion for solving complex problems, leading me to immerse myself in the fields of machine learning, web development, and cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>Throughout my academic career, I've been fortunate to work on a range of projects that have not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to make meaningful contributions to the field. One of my most notable projects involved the prediction of lung cancer using various machine learning algorithms, achieving a remarkable accuracy of up to 100% with SVM. This project, along with my research on breast cancer prediction, reflects my commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit. My research has also been recognized at the national level, where I was honored with the Best Research Paper Award at the National Conference on Recent Trends and Developments in Industry 4.0 (RTDI4-2024).</p>

        <p>My internship at the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) was a pivotal experience in my career. During this period, I delved deep into the application of dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and random projection in the context of high-dimensional data. I explored how these techniques could be utilized to improve the performance of machine learning models, particularly in predicting breast cancer. The hands-on experience I gained, coupled with the real-world implications of the project, solidified my interest in data science and reinforced my desire to use my skills for impactful research.</p>

        <p>In addition to my work in data science, I have a strong background in web development. I've developed several web-based applications, including a cancer prediction website and a platform to assist farmers with fertilizer and crop selection based on soil conditions. My approach to web development is rooted in the belief that technology should be accessible and user-centric, and I strive to create solutions that are both functional and intuitive. My experience with languages like Python and C++, as well as frameworks like Flask, has enabled me to bridge the gap between complex backend processes and seamless user experiences.</p>

        <p>As I continue to grow in my field, I am particularly drawn to the importance of cybersecurity. In today's digital age, safeguarding information and ensuring the integrity of systems is more critical than ever. I am committed to expanding my knowledge in this area and exploring how I can contribute to creating more secure digital environments.</p>

        <p>My journey so far has been one of continuous learning and growth, and I am excited about what the future holds. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals, engage in challenging projects, and continue pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
